    <string name="Heading_1"> SQLiteOpenHelper class </string>
    <string name="answer_1" translatable="true">
       The android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper class is used for database creation and version management.
        For performing any database operation,
        we have to provide the implementation of
        onCreate() and onUpgrade() methods of SQLiteOpenHelper class.
    </string>
    <string name="Question_B">B. What is the use of OnUpgrade function in SQLiteOpenHelper class?</string>
    <string name="answer_2">
        1) The purpose of onUpgrade is to manage a new database structure. We can start our app with simple features, then we need for instance to add a new column, so we need to increase the version of our database from 1 to 2 and in onUpgrade give the instruction to add a new column, so that if the user update the app, the new column become added.

         2) onUpgrade is called when we have a new version of our database and we incremented the int number in the super method( here is 1, so we eventually change it to 2)

          public static class DatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper{
    DatabaseHelper(Context context){
        super (context,DATABASE_NAME,null,1);
    }
        3) Please see above regarding what does it means to update the db

        4) We Drop the table and recreate, because to modify the table
        (example : for adding a new column that fits a new feature) a logic way to proceed could be, before to "destroy"/DROP the table and then create a new one with all the data. But this can be not the way to go although recreating the data could mean that the id numbers will be consecutive( usually are not consecutive: we could have 1, 2, and..4 because 3 has been deleted), hence dropping and then creating the table again, and eventually loading the previous data we could have this id consistency. Sometimes we may want to use ALTER instead of DROP. Why? Usually because using DROP the user loses the content already has in the database.

        C. How to show SQLite database table information in Android application what is the best
way to do it?
    </string>

    <string name="Heading_2"> Use table layout with cursor </string>
    <string name="answer_3">
    Description : Showing data base information will be better suited with table layout. since table layout is not an adapter view,
        we can not use cursor adapter with it.
        So use table layout with cursor to show data base table information.
